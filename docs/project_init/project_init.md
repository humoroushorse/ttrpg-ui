# Project Init

The project was intialized with the following command

```shell
 NX   Let's create a new workspace [https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro]

✔ Where would you like to create your workspace? · ttrpg-ui
✔ Which stack do you want to use? · angular
✔ Integrated monorepo, or standalone project? · integrated
✔ Application name · event-planning
✔ Which bundler would you like to use? · esbuild
✔ Default stylesheet format · scss
✔ Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? · No

✔ Test runner to use for end to end (E2E) tests · playwright
✔ Which CI provider would you like to use? · github

 NX   Creating your v19.8.0 workspace.
```

Then everything in ttrpg-ui was moved out of that directory into the root directory (flattened)

From here, refer to project init docs in their respective directories.
